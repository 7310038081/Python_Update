Typecasting in python

The conversion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting in python
or type conversion in python.

Python supports a wide variety of functions or methods like: int(), float(), str(), ord(), hex(), oct(), tuple(),
set(), list(), dict(), etc. for the type casting in python.

Two Types of Typecasting:
1.Explicit Conversion (Explicit type casting in python)
The conversion of one data type into another data type, done via developer or programmer's intervention
or manually as per the requirement, is known as explicit type conversion.


2.Implicit Conversion (Implicit type casting in python).
Data types in Python do not have the same level i.e. ordering of data types is not the same in Python.
Some of the data types have higher-order, and some have lower order.
While performing any operations on variables with different data types in Python, one of the variable's
data types will be changed to the higher data type. According to the level, one data type is converted
into other by the Python interpreter itself (automatically). This is called, implicit typecasting in
python.

Python converts a smaller data type to a higher data type to prevent data loss.

#Strings
In python, anything that you enclose between single or double quotation marks is considered a string.
