Python Sets:
1.Sets are unordered collection of data items.
2.They store multiple items in a single variable. Set items are separated by commas and enclosed 
within curly brackets {}.
3.Sets are unchangeable, meaning you cannot change items of the set once created.
4.Sets do not contain duplicate items.

Joining Sets:
1.Union and Update()
2.Intersection and Intersection_update()
3.Symmetric_difference() and Symmetric_difference_update()
4.difference() and difference_update()
