1.Lists are ordered collection of data items.
2.They store multiple items in a single variable.
3.List items are separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets [].
4.Lists are changeable meaning we can alter them after creation.

List Index:
Each item/element in a list has its own unique index. This index can be used to 
access any particular item from the list. The first item has index [0], second item 
has index [1], third item has index [2] and so on.

Positive Indexing:
As we have seen that list items have index, as such we can access items using these indexes.

Negative Indexing:
Similar to positive indexing, negative indexing is also used to access items, but from the end
of the list. The last item has index [-1], second last item has index [-2], third last item has
index [-3] and so on.

Check whether an item in present in the list?
We can check if a given item is present in the list. This is done using the in keyword.

Range of Index:
You can print a range of list items by specifying where you want to start, where do you want to end
and if you want to skip elements in between the range.

List Comprehension
List comprehensions are used for creating new lists from other iterables like lists, tuples,
dictionaries, sets, and even in arrays and strings.
